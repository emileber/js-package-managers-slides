## What about Duo?

A next-generation package manager that blends the best ideas from [Component](https://github.com/componentjs/component), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/) to make organizing and writing front-end code quick and painless.

```
$ npm install -g duo
```

Write normal JavaScript, requiring from GitHub as you need them.

```
var uid = require('matthewmueller/uid');
var fmt = require('yields/fmt');
```
