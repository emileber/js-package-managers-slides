## What about Bower?

Manages components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files.

```
$ npm install -g bower
$ bower install jquery --save
```

Dependencies are saved into the `bower_components` (customizable) and are listed in the `bower.json` file which is similar to the `package.json` file.
